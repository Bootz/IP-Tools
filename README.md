# IP Tools for Android

IP Tools for Android is a simple networking tool written in Java.
Most of the basic network commands it performs directly through the Linux kernel,
which probably isn't best practice. 
I did this due to the limitations of Java and lack of knowledge of C/C++ to use the NDK

I have currently discontinued any further development
